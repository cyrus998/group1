# Terms of Services

Eden Academy is regarded as the top school in the nation. It has a student body of roughly 2500, ranging from ages 6 to 19. Its strict education and that many of its students and alumni come from families with prominent status has made it extremely desirable for families to enroll their children. Some parents even offer "donations" to enroll their children or buy good grades, but it has been made clear that the headmaster and school administration are not easily bought.

It has been noted that there is a gulf between the alumni families and first-generation students that leads to bullying and discrimination in the student body.

Students are divided into dormitory boarders and commuters. Students who do not stay in the school dormitories travel to school by bus or in their own chauffeured car.

There are a total of 8 classes or groups for each year.

Curriculum
In First Year, there are four core subjects; History, Math, Science, and Reading. During Midterm Exams, students are tested on each of these subjects. Other secondary subjects include Physical Education, Arts and Crafts, and Classical Language.

After the exams, the completed tests are kept in a tightly guarded vault in North Hall until grading is completed.

Stella Stars are awarded to the highest and second-highest performing students of each grade for each of the subjects. Any students who fail will receive a Tonitrus Bolt, without exception.

At the end of the term, students are divided into new classes based on their ability and performance.
